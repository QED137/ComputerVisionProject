# CIFAR-10 Computer Vision Models
## Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning models developed for a computer vision project using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes two different approaches:

A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline model.
An advanced model utilizing transfer learning with ResNet50.

# Models
## Baseline CNN Model

Description: 
The baseline model is a simple CNN designed to establish an initial performance benchmark.
Performance:
The model showed limited accuracy, as indicated by the learning curves and confusion matrix.

## ResNet50 Transfer Learning Model

Description: This model employs transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture, enhanced with additional preprocessing steps.
Performance: Significant improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline model, as evidenced by the learning curves and confusion matrix analysis.

R
## Setup and Usage
### Installation
- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running the Models
Run `main.py` to train and evaluate both the baseline CNN and the ResNet50 models:
- `python main.py`

This script will handle the following:
- Load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Train and evaluate the baseline CNN model.
- Train and evaluate the ResNet50 model.
- Perform data augmentation for training the models.
- Generate confusion matrices and ROC curves for performance analysis.

## Results
- The script `main.py` includes evaluation methods like confusion matrices and ROC curve analysis.
- Check the output directory for saved model weights and performance metrics.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow 2.x
    OpenCV

Installation

lone the repository: git clone https://github.com/QED137ComputerVisionProject.git
    Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Models

 python3 main.py

Results and Analysis

Learning curves and confusion matrices for each model can be found within their respective directories. A comprehensive analysis and comparison of both models are detailed in the project report, where available. Due to space and computational constraints, the ResNet50 model was trained for only 5 epochs, and its learning curves are presented accordingly. This limitation is primarily due to GPU and CPU resource considerations.
