CIFAR-10 Computer Vision Models
Project Overview

This repository contains machine learning models developed for a computer vision project using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes two different approaches:

    A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline model.
    An advanced model utilizing transfer learning with ResNet50.

Models
Baseline CNN Model

    Description: The baseline model is a simple CNN designed to establish an initial performance benchmark.
    Performance: The model showed limited accuracy, as indicated by the learning curves and confusion matrix.

ResNet50 Transfer Learning Model

    Description: This model employs transfer learning with the ResNet50 architecture, enhanced with additional preprocessing steps.
    Performance: Significant improvement in accuracy compared to the baseline model, as evidenced by the learning curves and confusion matrix analysis.
